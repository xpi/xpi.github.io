I made a thing. It's called [Vimdeck](https://raw.github.com/tybenz/vimdeck/master/img/demo3.png)
and it lets you write a presentation
in a single markdown file and then converts that file into multiple "slides"
to be opened and shared in Vim.

Buffers as slides. Genius, no? Plus, I added some ascii art conversion stuff too.

Head over to the [GitHub page](http://github.com/tybenz/vimdeck) to check it out.
