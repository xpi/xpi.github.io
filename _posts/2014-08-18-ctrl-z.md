title: "Better ctrl-z for Vim"
---

I stumbled onto [&ldquo;How to boost your Vim productivity&rdquo;] [1] the other day and
it&#8217;s full of awesome Vim tips.  One of them involved improving ctrl-z.

For those of you who don&#8217;t know. You can hit `ctrl-z` from within Vim and it
puts Vim in the background and returns you to your shell. You can type in the
command `fg` into your shell to get back into Vim. I use this workflow all the
time. It&#8217;s **much** nicer to use an actual console to do file system stuff then
many of the other Vim-specific workarounds out there (although I will say that
[vim-eunuch] [2] is awesome).

One huge problem with this approach is typing `fg<CR>` is annoying. And I never
knew it until I read this article. The author has managed to map `ctrl-z` to not
only send Vim into background mode but also return to Vim when you&#8217;re ready.

He achieves this through ZSH scripting. I&#8217;m a dedicated iTerm2 and BASH user,
so I was immediately disappointed that this awesome tip didn&#8217;t apply to me.

So I figured out how to do it in BASH and iTerm2. You can take a look here:
<https://github.com/tybenz/ctrl-z>.

It uses iTerm2&#8217;s custom key bindings with something called a coprocess.
The coprocess itself is just a BASH script. Feel free to check it out. If you
follow the steps, you&#8217;ll be up-and-running in no time and using
`ctrl-z` up and down the street. Good luck nerds!
