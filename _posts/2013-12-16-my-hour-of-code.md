This past week was [code.org's](http://code.org) first [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org). They set a goal of getting 10 million students worldwide to participate
in an hour of code (they ended up with over 16 million). Code.org and many other participating organizations created self-guided tutorials to walk students through the fundamentals
of programming.

I was able to help out at a [Hickman Charter School](http://hcs.hickmanschools.org) by adding a short presentation on what code is all about. I'm extremely appreciative of
code.org's efforts to educate young people on such an important topic. Here's some photos from the event:
