title: "Gitwar: Gaming with Git"
---

I recently came across a [blog
post](https://github.com/blog/1499-the-revolution-will-be-forked) that talked about non-developers using Git and GitHub to
do some pretty cool things. It got me thinking about other cool and unusual
things possible with GitHub.

Then I started thinking about games and wondered what it would look like
to have a game with Git at the center. Not something as lame as "who can
create the most branches with the most inappropriate names in the
shortest amount of time?" More like a family of two-player,
head-to-head, text-based, turn-based games with Git as the transfer
protocol.

So I made one, and I did it all in **BASH**.

The games are built using a "platform" called
[Gitwar](http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar). It's a shared
utility that takes care of adding, committing, pushing, and pulling
to/from the shared repo.

The first game is called
[Gitfight](http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitfight) and it's an incredibly simple/corny game where
you tell the game what kind of punch you'd like to throw at your
opponent and basically roll a virtual die to see how much damage you
deal. After you submit your punch, Gitwar takes over and commits that
action to your repo and your opponent can have a chance to punch back.

The second game was an obvious choice. It's called
[Gitchess](http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar/tree/master/gitchess). This is
where I had the most fun. Creating a more complex game in BASH proved to
be a difficult but satisfying challenge.

It was really fun to make, and I'm eager to find out what other types of
command-line games can be built on top of a pattern like this. Be sure to check out the
Gitwar repo [here](http://github.com/gitwar/gitwar). And give me a shoutout on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?text=%40tybenz&url=http://tybenz.com/post/gitwar) if you have comments.
