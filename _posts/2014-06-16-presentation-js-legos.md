I've been doing this talk on Reusable UI Components in JavaScript for a while
now. I gave the last on at the [HTML5 Developer Conference] [html5devconf] in
May (hopefully will have a video soon). The talk is an adaptation from a
[previous blog post] [widgetize] about reusable UI components in JavaScript.
I've also given versions of the talk at [jQuery Europe] [jqeu], [jQuery San
Diego] [jqcon] and [SSDG] [ssdg].

Slides are posted here:

Also, I'm releasing this small open-source UI component library as part of the talk, called **lego.js**.
It's really just meant to be a repository of more in-depth code samples of the kind of components
presented in the talk. Feel free to check it out:
